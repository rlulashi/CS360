Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was designed to create events, store them in a database, modify, and delete events after logging in. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A login screen, a registration screen, and a main screen to view events. I envisioned a calendar app similar to the default one on most phones. The UI had the screens needed to faciliate 
the needs because the main screen is tailored for this goal. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I started by working on a UI I drew that I could then recreate in Android Studios. Once I had the framework, the goal was to focus on implementation. I believe taking the time to design a solid UI, the work is able to be managed much easier. If a clear vision is not available, then it will be impossible to settle on implementation if without having an end in sight. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Many tests were done for each small step to get the best result. By setting codebreaks to see where something could go faulty. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The overall project was quite a challenge and the actual UI needed some modifications due to still being inexperienced as a developer. I had issues handling color combinations to meet guidelines.
I would have to reset my console due to how demanding it can be to run two systems simuletaneously. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Ceating a user-friendly is where I feel I can display my skills better.
